# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Machine learning model to predict the prices of homes in Bengaluru, India.
Used sklearn and linear regression to build the model using a home prices data set from kaggle.com.
Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridSearchCV to find the best model.
Wrote python flask server that uses model to serve http requests.
Built website using html, css, and JavaScript that allows the user to input square foot area, number of baths, etc. which then calls the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
